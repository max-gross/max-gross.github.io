Originally from the Philadelphia area, I graduated from the University of Maryland in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science in mathematics and a Bachelor of Arts in economics. I continued studying economics at the University of Michigan and completed my Ph.D. in 2020. I now work as a Researcher at [Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/) in the Human Services division.

I am an applied microeconomist motivated by improving the lives of historically underserved children and youth. My research uses large administrative data and quantitative methods to engage with public policy. I am happy to be affiliated with the [Education Policy Initiative](http://www.edpolicy.umich.edu/) and [Youth Policy Lab](http://youthpolicylab.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan.

Outside of my professional life, I am a volleyball player, the commissioner of a Top Chef fantasy league, and a [truster of the process](https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/21/16038856/sam-hinkie-philadelphia-76ers-process-draft-markelle-fultz-bb1b060ee4a5).
